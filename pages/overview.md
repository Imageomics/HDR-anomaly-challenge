# Butterfly Hybrid Detection
### Brought to you by Imageomics Institute as part of the 2024 HDR Anomaly ML Challenge
[Explain butterfly hybrids and mimicry]

## Timeline

This ML Challenge starts on June 15, 2024 and will run through September [end day], 2024. Be sure to resubmit your preferred model from the development phase by [date, time]; it will then be run on the test sets to detect hybrids of Species A and its major hybrid mimics. Only one submission will be run against the test sets to determine your final score in the challenge.
