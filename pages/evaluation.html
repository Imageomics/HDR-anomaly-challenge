<h1>Butterfly Hybrid Detection: Evaluation</h1>
<p>This is an anomaly detection problem, where the goal is to find hybrid butterflies. [Add more info].&nbsp;<br /><br />There are 2 phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Development phase.&nbsp;The provided training data contains images of all Species A subspecies with a signal set of the "Major hybrids" (the most common hybrids). The goal is to train a model to detect hybrids. Unlabeled validation and test data will also be provided. These include the Major and Minor (less common) hybrid subspecies of Species A ([test/valid]_A) and the Species B mimics of the Major hybrids and their parent subspecies ([test/valid]_mimic). Upload your model's predictions for both datasets ([or will we have them upload models?]); feedback will be provided on the validation performance for each component until the end of the challenge. (Do we want to keep this condition as in the iris sampl so it doesn't wind up dominated by one or two participants?:) Only the performance of a participant's MOST RECENT submission on the validation sets will be displayed on the leaderboard.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Final phase.&nbsp;Automatic at the end of the challenge. Each participant's latest submission will be evaluated on the final test sets and scores will be posted to the leaderboard. A3D3 has: Resubmit your preferred submission from the development phase to test against a new set of testing data. Your model will be trained against the same set of training data as in the development phase. You may only make one submission to this phase, so choose wisely.</li>
</ul>
<p>This competition allows you to submit (We need to pick one as a group):</p>
<ul>
<li>Only prediction results (no code).</li>
<li>A pre-trained prediction model.</li>
</ul>
<p>The submissions are evaluated based on the number of correctly identified hybrids assuming 95% accuracy on recognizing non-hybrids (improve this description to be more technically clear).</p>
