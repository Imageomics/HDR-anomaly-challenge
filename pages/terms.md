# Butterfly Hybrid Detection: Rules

Submissions must be made before the end of phase 1. You may make 1 submission every day of the challenge; the last submission will be used to determine the winner.

This challenge is governed by the [HDR ML Challenge Terms and Conditions](https://www.nsfhdr.org/mlchallenge).



This competition is intended to encourage and promote open science.
In the spirit of open science, we expect the final training code and trained models to be publicly shared at the end of the challenge under an open-source license (e.g., a public GitHub repo with an MIT license; see [Imageomics/HDR-anomaly-challenge-sample](https://github.com/Imageomics/HDR-anomaly-challenge-sample) for an example format).
As such, we expect that any pre-trained models used for this competition (e.g., for model initialization) will also be shared under an [OSI-approved](https://opensource.org/licenses) open-source license. However, the use of additional outside data is _not_ permitted. For example, curating additional training images beyond the provided training/signal data is not permitted. Augmentation of the provided data (e.g., cropping, flipping, rotation, etc.) is allowed.
